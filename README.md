# Hello World in Android

Hello Word project, used as introduction to Android apps development in the elective course &quot;CPSC-3367 Mobile Apps Development&quot; from UA Little Rock

## Description

Very basic Android app with just only one activity. The layout of the activity is simply composed by three of the most common Android GUI elements: a TextEdit, a TextView and a Button.  
The user can input some text in the EditText element. When he taps the button the text is displayed through the TextView element.

## Branches

- <ins>1-hello-world.</ins> It provides the described functionality, using findViewById to get references to the several elements in the layout.
  
- <ins>2-hello-world-view-binding.</ins> It provides the same functionality, but it uses view binding in order to get reference of the elements in the layout from the Activity class.
